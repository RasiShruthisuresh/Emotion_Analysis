I was really excited about this dress—the color is exactly as shown, and the material feels premium. 
However, after wearing it for a day, I noticed the seams were coming loose, which was disappointing. 
On the other hand, my friend ordered the same dress in a different size, and hers was absolutely perfect. 
Meanwhile, the jeans I bought were super comfortable and fit like a dream, but they had a weird factory smell that took multiple washes to go away. 
I loved the style, though, so I guess it was worth it. 
As for the jacket, it looked gorgeous in the photos, but the fabric is thinner than expected.
It’s stylish but definitely not warm enough for winter
