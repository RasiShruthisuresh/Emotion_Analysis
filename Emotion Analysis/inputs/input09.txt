I can't believe I wasted my money on this garbage. The dress looked stunning in the pictures, but in reality, it feels like cheap plastic. The stitching started unraveling after just one wear, and the fabric is so uncomfortable it feels like sandpaper on my skin. The jeans were even worse—horrible fit, smelled like chemicals, and felt like they were made from recycled cardboard. And don’t even get me started on the so-called ‘premium’ jacket. It’s paper-thin, offers zero warmth, and looks nothing like the product images. This is a complete scam, and I wouldn’t recommend this brand to my worst enemy!
